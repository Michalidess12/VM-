This repository contains a simple responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design uses a blue futuristic theme and includes some light-hearted text.

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (mobile or desktop) to try it out. The page features a dancing Homer Simpson gif above the display and shows an approximate world population counter below the calculator that updates every second.
